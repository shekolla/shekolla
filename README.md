# Hi there, I'm Shekolla Sai Kiran!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am an experienced software engineer with a passion for leveraging technology to enhance financial experiences. With a strong background in building innovative solutions, I have gained valuable expertise in various domains over the course of my career.

## Experience

### Figg powered by Finoramic
**Senior Software Engineer** (January 2022 - Present) | **Software Engineer** (June 2019 - January 2022)

At Figg, a startup powered by Finoramic, I have been instrumental in creating a comprehensive financial platform aimed at simplifying the lives of users. My contributions include developing a powerful Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine to extract financial data from diverse sources and applying machine learning techniques to improve data accuracy. I have also designed algorithms to process financial PDFs and created a testing framework for the parsing engine. Additionally, I have built interactive dashboards for clients and implemented custom data structures to enhance parsing speed and accuracy. Currently, I am involved in developing an in-house deep learning engine to further increase accuracy and efficiency.

### Raltin
**Machine Learning Engineer** (June 2018 - May 2019)

During my time at Raltin, I focused on building financial portfolios using historical correlation between stocks. I successfully utilized the Pearson Coefficient and experimented with various correlation coefficients to construct highly correlated stock portfolios. Additionally, I developed machine learning models leveraging 50+ financial indicators, employing Neural Networks for their implementation. As part of a small team, I also contributed to developing a basic front-end using Django.

### Accenture
**Software Engineer** (March 2017 - May 2018)

At Accenture, I kickstarted my software engineering career by building an automation engine that allowed clients to collect and scrape data using Python and Beautiful Soup.
